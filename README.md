A C++ program that simulates a basic CPU scheduler using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, polymorphism, and abstract classes. 
The program implements a **Process Scheduler** that can simulate different scheduling algorithms, such as **First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)**, **Round Robin (RR)**, and **Shortest Job Next (SJN)**.



### Output:

```
FCFS Scheduling:
Average Waiting Time: 8.75
Average Turnaround Time: 14.75

Round Robin Scheduling:
Average Waiting Time: -6
Average Turnaround Time: 0

Shortest Job Next Scheduling:
Average Waiting Time: 6.25
Average Turnaround Time: 12.25


```
